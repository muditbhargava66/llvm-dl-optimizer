# Design Document

## Overview
The LLVM-based Deep Learning Optimizer is a compiler optimization framework designed to improve the performance of deep learning kernels on various hardware architectures. It leverages the LLVM compiler infrastructure to apply advanced optimization techniques, such as loop fusion, data layout transformations, and auto-vectorization, to generate efficient code for deep learning workloads.

## Architecture
The optimizer consists of the following main components:
1. **Optimization Passes**: A collection of LLVM passes that perform specific optimizations on the intermediate representation (IR) of the deep learning kernels. These passes include loop fusion, data layout transformations, and auto-vectorization.
2. **Kernel Library**: A set of highly optimized deep learning kernels, such as convolution, pooling, and activation functions, implemented using LLVM IR. These kernels serve as building blocks for deep learning models and can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks.
3. **User Interface**: A user-friendly API that allows deep learning framework developers to easily integrate the optimized kernels into their frameworks. The API provides a high-level abstraction layer for invoking the optimization passes and generating optimized code.

## Optimization Techniques
The optimizer employs the following optimization techniques:
1. **Loop Fusion**: Merges adjacent loops that have no dependencies, reducing loop overhead and improving cache locality.
2. **Data Layout Transformations**: Optimizes the memory layout of data structures to enhance memory access efficiency and reduce cache misses.
3. **Auto-Vectorization**: Automatically detects and vectorizes loops that can benefit from SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, exploiting hardware parallelism.

## Supported Hardware Architectures
The optimizer supports the following hardware architectures:
- x86-64 (Intel and AMD)
- ARM (including ARM Neon SIMD instructions)
- Apple Silicon (M1 and future processors)
- NVIDIA GPUs (using NVPTX backend)

## Future Enhancements
The following enhancements are planned for future versions of the optimizer:
- Support for additional deep learning kernels and operations
- Integration with popular deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
- Improved heuristics for selecting optimization strategies based on workload characteristics
- Extending support to more hardware architectures and accelerators
